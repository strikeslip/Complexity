<b>"Attention Is All You Need"</b>

Algorithmic information theory is known to be basically founded upon three main mathematical concepts and the relations between them: algorithmic complexity, algorithmic randomness, and algorithmic probability.

<b>Translational Models, Mathematical Models, and AI Tools.</b>

1. Translational models focus on converting concepts or structures from one domain to another, such as transforming visual patterns into musical sequences or translating emotional states into sonic expressions.

2. Mathematical models employ formal mathematical structures and operations to generate musical material, often drawing from fields like chaos theory, fractals, and combinatorics.

3. AI tools leverage machine learning techniques to learn patterns from existing music and generate new compositions that reflect or extend these patterns.
